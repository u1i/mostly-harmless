Neolithic revolution

Around 10,000 years ago, mankind began to move away from living life as nomadic hunter gatherers, and began settling down to farm land. Ice age was barely over, the last mammoths were still lukewarm and people were fed up from walking around endlessly, hunting deer and picking up berries on the go. After all, it was a lot more fun to breed pigs they could butcher whenever they were short of bacon, sit together making master plans for Stonehenge and the pyramids and get totally schnockered from a brand new beverage from Mesopotamia, a by-product from the newly cultivated grain and probably the greatest innovation of all times: beer.

What would today's pets look like if our prehistoric ancestors had decided to domesticate beavers or otters instead of cats and dogs? Is anybody reading this? And, most importantly, have you seen that our favourite bar is now serving ice-cold Sapporo draught at happy hour prices?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you at the marvelous 'News & Gossip'!
