Hitchhikers,

today I was walking by the place where our meetup group was born and we had 25 events â€“ a bar that used to be called 'News & Gossip' and is re-opening soon under a different name & a different owner. It's a good reminder that nothing lasts forever.

In our quest to bring you the awesomest, quirkiest venues within CBD we have decided to give the 'Tipsy Owl' a shot and we hope you like it there! Well. The place is actually going under the name 'Bakery and Bar', and somehow, also by 'The Muffinery' but only during the day, after that they're calling it 'At Night', and no longer 'Tipsy Owl'. Kind of. Now - that's exactly the wicked kind of stuff we like. 

Event: The Big Bang Theory
Date & Time: Tuesday, November 5th, 7 pm
Venue: Tipsy Owl / The Muffinery at Night - 112 Telok Ayer
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/266042253

Hope to see you there!

Uli
