Hitchhikers,

aaaaaand we're back! It feels like an eternity since we've seen each other, I've just come back from a series of trips and it's great to be home. Let's get together next week and catch up over drinks!

Date & Time: Tuesday, July 16th, 7pm

We'll be missing Diana, our dear co-founder of the group who is no longer able to join us, as she's fully focused on new projects. Thanks for all, Dee!
