Subject: Next week: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!

Hitchhikers,

dark skies, rainy days – Europe in December is often like this. Now, if you're feeling blue about the Singapore version of this, we have good news for you: Our wonderful group is sending off the year in style, over chats and drinks and that is happening next week!

Hope to see you there!

Uli

"Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable part of the galaxy lies an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper — unless they're busy making life miserable for each other.

Then, one Tuesday, nearly six hundred years after one man had invented the letterpress, two nerds sitting at a bar in Robinson Road suddenly realized how they could, occasionally and just for a few hours, turn the world into a good and happy place.

This is the story of 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity.

It begins with a pint."
