Subject: Do you know the Muffin Man?

To be sure: I don't know the Muffin Man. He may live in Drury Lane, but that's just hearsay.
What I *DO* know is that our event is tomorrow! And just in case you haven't seen the news yet: we have a new venue!

It's right here: http://bit.ly/muffinry

The wonderful folks there told me we can have that big couch area in the 2nd floor – Big Bang Theory, hello! 

Hope to see you there :)

Event: The Big Bang Theory
Date & Time: Tuesday, November 5th, 7 pm

After several failed attempts of creating the perfect universe, Ralph sat down over a cup of tea about 13.8 billion years and 17 days ago to reflect about things. His work always had its initial beauty with the brightest stars, breathtaking planets and vast amounts of nothingness in between – but whatever he tried, the system always ended up developing bugs, humans and boy bands which made things unbearable and usually forced him to toss everything into the bin and start over. Deciding to give it one last shot he pressed the 'reboot' button with one big sigh, hoping for the best.

Are we getting it right this time? Did the Big Bang actually happen? And most importantly, are they serving primordial soup at the new venue?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you at the Tipsy Owl!
