Hitchhikers,

join us tomorrow night in town at our intellectual panic room for a very special edition - we're turning one! To celebrate the occasion we're inviting selected guests to try our latest creation: the ‘Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster’, a famous drink which makes you feel like having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. Our lawyers are still working out how to include the necessary rehabilitation costs into the market price, as it has been made clear to us that these would not be covered by MediShield. You might want to consider bringing a towel 

Hope to see you there!

Diana & Uli

Date & Time: Tuesday, March 12th, 7pm
Location: News & Gossip @ Robinson Road

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable part of the galaxy lies an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper — unless they're busy making life miserable for each other.

Then, one Tuesday, nearly six hundred years after one man had invented the letterpress, two nerds sitting at a bar in Robinson Road suddenly realized how they could, occasionally and just for a few hours, turn the world into a good and happy place.

This is the story of 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity.

It begins with a pint.
