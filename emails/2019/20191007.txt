Hitchhikers,

next week will be our last event at the News & Gossip as they're closing down our beloved bar. If you like our little group & our meetups, make sure you come this one last time. Bring a friend. No – bring two friends! And if you've always wanted to join us but for some reason have not been able to, well... this is your last chance. Are we going to come back? We might, or we might not, but it will definitely be different.

Date: Tuesday, October 15th
Time: 7 pm
Location: News & Gossip, Robinson Road, Singapore
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/265202713/

In 1637 French jurist and hobby mathematician Pierre de Fermat stumbled upon an equation in an old book he was reading, and scribbled in the margins that he had "a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which the margin is too narrow to contain". He obviously had no clue about the matter, but vastly enjoyed winding up people – and avoided any follow-up questions by simply passing away. As a result, mathematicians around the world have wasted 300 years trying to prove that no nth power can be the sum of two other nth powers, where n is greater than 2. Or something.

Are there simple proofs of Fermat's theorem? What has maths done for us lately, anyway? And, most importantly, can we count on you to join our fabulous meetup?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you, one last time, at the marvelous 'News & Gossip'!
