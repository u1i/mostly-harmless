Subject: Einstein, baby!

Hitchhikers,

What is time? In physics, time and space are woven together, like a fabric upon which all matter lies. At the limits, near the speed of light, movement in time is yoked to movement in space. As spatial speed increases, temporal speed slows. Recent quantum physics suggests that both time and space are not as they appear on our scale of existence. It appears that particles, separated in both space and time, interact, in a simultaneous manner. Indeed, in one of the strangest experimental effects, the future may causally impact the past (the implications of that one will make your head spin). Distant particles are somehow connected, are somehow not distant. It is as if the space and time between did not really exist, nor the proposed distinction. Rather, some of these physicists suggest that perhaps there is an underlying singularity or unity to matter, across both time and space. It goes without saying that our residential quantum physicist Amanda will be able to explain that much better than I can.

So what is time? On a psychological level, time is quite malleable as well. When life speeds up, time slows down. You've met someone two months ago and it feels like you've known them your entire life. Of course things are not that simple. Time goes slowly when one lacks meaning as well. Not hearing from your special someone for a day and it feels you've grown a year older. Or think back to the old clock on the wall of your last class of the week back in high-school.

On a deeply practical level, each moment in time carries the potential for joy within our lives. Let's talk about that over a couple of drinks. Or just shoot the breeze. Or go down to the square and plant ten sequoia trees while saying grace and humming a familiar m...elodie. 

Hope to see you next week!

Uli
