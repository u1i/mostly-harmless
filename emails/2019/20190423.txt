Hitchhikers,

you may be aware – there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. And then there is another theory which states that this has already happened, maybe even multiple times 

There's a good chance we might even touch on that topic at our meetup next week! We're excited about the new people that joined the group recently and mad happy when a familiar face shows up at our intellectual panic room for a drink and a chat. Hope to see you on Tuesday! 

Date & Time: Tuesday, April 30th 7 pm
Location: News & Gossip, Robinson Road, Singapore
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/260801435/

Humans had always assumed that they were way more intelligent than dolphins because they had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons.

Was coming down from the trees a mistake? Who had that genius idea of leaving the oceans, anyway? And what's equivalent to a great kebab in the dolphin world?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you at the marvelous 'News & Gossip'!
