Next week: Achilles and the Tortoise

Hitchhikers,

there was a time when I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not so sure anymore. Of course I knew that 87.5% of all statistics were made up, so I asked myself: What if there were no hypothetical questions? I'm well aware that my apathy causes me problems, but I really don't care â€“ all generalizations are wrong, anyway! So I immediately cancelled the workshop on procrastination







Anyone who visits a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined.

I'm trying to be less self-deprecating, but I really suck at it.


I want to join the Optimist's Club, but they probably won't accept me.

I'm sorry, am I repeating myself? Am I being redundant? Am I saying things over and over? 

It brings bad luck to be superstitious.

Non-conformists of the world, unite! 

A self-reference walks into a joke. This one.
