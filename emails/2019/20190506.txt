Next week: Achilles and the Tortoise

A self-reference walks into a joke. This one.

Hitchhikers,

there was a time when I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not so sure anymore. I knew that 87.5% of all statistics were made up, so I asked myself: What if there were no hypothetical questions? I'm of course well aware that my apathy causes me problems, but I really don't care â€“ all generalizations are wrong, anyway! So I immediately cancelled the workshop on procrastination, and went to the neighborhood bookstore. For some reason the sales lady there would refuse to show me where the self-help section was, so I said: "I'm sorry, am I repeating myself? Am I being redundant? Am I saying things over and over?" But there was no reply, I guess it brings bad luck to be superstitious.

I'm really trying to be less self-deprecating, but I'm really bad at it. Maybe I should consider joining the Optimist's Club, but they probably won't accept me. So, by now I'm pretty convinced that anyone who visits a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined.

Non-conformists of the world, unite!
