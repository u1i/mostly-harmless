Hitchhikers,

the phrase, “you are what you eat” is literally true. Nutrients from the foods you eat food provide the foundation of the structure, function, and integrity of every little cell in our bodies, from our skin and hair to the muscles, bones, digestive and immune systems. You may not feel it, but you’re constantly repairing, healing and rebuilding your body. Which means it's quite important what you put on your plate. Food technology has brought us some of the worst innovations in history (to me a great example is that unbearable 'coffee creamer' - give me fresh milk!) so it's good to see the growing interest by consumers in “organic”, and “natural” foods, as well as in food production practices that are less harmful to the environment, and the new way people in modern civilizations look at food and make food choices. 

Let's talk about this over fries & beer at our next meetup :-)
Hope to see you there!
