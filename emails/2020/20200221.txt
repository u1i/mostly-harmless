Hitchhikers,

on December 31st we thought what a mad year 2019 had been â€“ and a few weeks later, nothing is the same anymore with escalating health situations, uncertainty, and widely spread irrational behaviour. We'd joke about it on another day, but here we'd simply mention the number of casualties from the tobacco virus each year, the WHO says it's 8 million people.

We'd like to invite you to have a drink with us next week. If you're not up for it (yet), we understand. If you're unwell, by all means, do stay at home. But if you can make it, we'd love to hang out together at one of the nicest, classiest places you can find in Telok Ayer. It's a place where the manager hangs out at the bar, talking with guests. Where one of the barkeeper has a photo exhibition going and will gladly walk you through it. And, it's a place where hitchhikers enjoy an all night long happy hour!

And with this, we present you our usual tongue-in-cheek invitation and hope you can make it! Bring a friend!

Date: Tuesday, February 25th
Time: 7 pm
Location: Telok Ayer Arts Club, 2 McCallum Street, Singapore
