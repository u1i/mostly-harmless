It's a lovely Friday afternoon in Mountain View, California when a 2,400-year-old dude in sandals walks into the Google headquarters at Amphitheatre Parkway. Plato, best-selling author of paperback novels including 'The Republic' and 'Symposium' is accompanied by his agent who had the genius idea for him to go on a book tour promoting his latest work, 'Philosophy for Dummies'. And just as the crowd of Googlers pours into the pantry to play with their phones during his Q&A session, our time-traveling writer does what he usually does best: questioning the whole thing.

What would Plato think of Google's omniscient search engine that grows smarter by the day? Is philosophy still relevant to us in 2020? And most importantly, is it safe to assume that Plato got his fix of Gyros at the Google canteen?

This is Mostly Harmless, where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you in Telok Ayer!
