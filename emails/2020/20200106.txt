Hitchhikers,

Geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meeting over drinks to discuss current affairs and hot topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. The impact of 'digital' on the way we communicate, work and learn. The question whether there's intelligent life on earth. And sometimes, it's really just about where in town they serve the best kebab.
This is 'Mostly Harmless' and we look forward to welcoming new members and old friends tomorrow:

Date: Tuesday, February 7th
Time: 7 pm
Location: Telok Ayer Arts Club, 2 McCallum Street, Singapore
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/267439650/

Hope to see you there!
Uli
