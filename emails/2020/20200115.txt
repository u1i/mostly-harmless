Subject: Next week: The Quantum Zeno Paradox

Hitchhikers,

Amanda, our resident quantum physicist is moving to the US - let's send her off in style at our event next week. Now, we neither confirm nor deny the rumors that she's going to work with Elon Musk on an intergalatic super weapon, but she may tell you about some of her plans in person.

Join us in our intellectual panic room over a drink! Electrons are dining free of charge :)

Hope to see you there!
Uli

Your Grab won't arrive faster if you keep staring at the cartoon car moving across the map on your phone. Paint always dries at the same speed, no matter whether the poor fellow is watching it or not. Yet â€“ on a quantum level, it is indeed possible to "slow time" just by measuring the state of a particle. How is this possible? Does it mean fitness trackers are in fact useless? And, most importantly, would a diet be more effective if we stopped stepping on the scale all the time?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you in Telok Ayer!
