Hitchhikers,

welcome to the first geek cafe to open in the new world – it's quite a different venue I must say, and it will take some time getting used to it. But intergalactic travelers operate between several dimensions and the various planet atmospheres, anyway, so let's just try this.

If you have time today around 7pm, do join us. While it's technically possible to do so without a drink in your hand, it's not recommended.

RSVP here - we will send the password to confirmed participants only: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/269882952/

Humans had always assumed that they were way more intelligent than dolphins because they had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons.

Was coming down from the trees a mistake? Who had that genius idea of leaving the oceans, anyway? And what's the equivalent to a great kebab in the dolphin world?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you there!
