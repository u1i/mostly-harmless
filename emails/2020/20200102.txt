Hitchhikers,

the year 2020: once a far-off time, once a vessel for writers and filmmakers to explore their hopes, dreams, and fears of the future. A time to wonder what advanced technology weâ€™d be living with, and how much societal and moral progress we would have made. If any.

But reality has trouble keeping up with imagination. 2000 arrived without our electronics turning on us. We threw away our granite Maya calendars when 2012 came and went with nary a shower of brimstone. The year 2015 went by and until this very day, we still don't have Mattel pink hoverboards! Will 2020 have more success? Are we getting drone taxis in Singapore? And, more importantly, where have all the currywurst places gone?

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you at the wonderful Telok Ayer Arts Club where we enjoy an all night long happy hour!

Date: Tuesday, February 7th
Time: 7 pm
Location: Telok Ayer Arts Club, 2 McCallum Street, Singapore
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/267439650/
