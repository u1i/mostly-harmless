Subject: Why are you here? | Poll

Hitchhikers!

why are you here? This is, of course, quite a philosophical question. Yet - on this cloudy Sunday afternoon we're somewhat more down to earth. By now you will have noticed that this group is quite different from most of the others on meetup.com ... so our question is rather: what made you join this group? Please look at our poll and tell us why you're here. (alternatively, here is the URL https://www.meetup.co...­ )

After our hugely successful first meetup, we're storming ahead and have already placed
meetup #2 in our calendars! Check it out & rsvp here:&nbsp;https://www.meetup.co...­

We might see you there! This we mean quite literally. Diana can't make it most likely, Uli's (travel?) schedule for that week is not confirmed yet. Heard of driverless cars? We'd be proud to have the first organizer-less meetup!

Wishing you a fun & successful week.

Uli
