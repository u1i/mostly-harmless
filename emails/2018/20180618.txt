Is anybody reading those emails, anyway? In fact, we're pretty happy when people who come to the meetups are telling us that, indeed, they do read those - and at times even enjoy them! I'm somewhat stuck in Bangkok at the moment with most of the Singapore Airlines flights booked out this week. An interesting situation which may or may not have been an inspiring factor for the topic of next week's meetup:
