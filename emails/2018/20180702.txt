Hitchhikers,

last month I was visiting in Europe visiting family - and each time I'm at my parents' house I'd go to that shelf with the photo albums, looking at childhood memories. My dad used to paste opera tickets, museum pamphlets and these things next to the pictures, so going through the pages always feels like going back in time.
