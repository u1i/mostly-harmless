Hitchhikers,

last month I was visiting in Europe visiting family - and each time I'm at my parents' house I'd go to that shelf with the photo albums, looking at childhood memories. My dad used to paste opera tickets, museum pamphlets and these things next to the pictures, so going through the pages always feels like going back in time.

Fast forward to 2018, where we most people are using their phones to take pictures, and share them with friends and family using social media like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. How can we preserve important photos and documents for a longer period of time? Are we certain that iCloud and Google Photos will still be there in 50 years? Will PDF and PNG still be acceptable document formats? I still have a floppy disk somewhere that I use for laughs, but also to illustrate the point that these things are changing incredibly fast. For those among the readers who have not seen a floppy disk - it looks like a 3D printed copy of the 'Save' icon from your application of choice :)

And with this .... we're off into Meetup #10 of Mostly Harmless next week! I think it's spectacular that people would even travel down to Singapore all the way to KL just to join our discussion. 

Time & Date: Tuesday, July 10th
Venue: The News & Gossip Cafe, Robinson Road, Singapore
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/250893617/

See you there!
