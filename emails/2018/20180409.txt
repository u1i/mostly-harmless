Subject: Gutenberg's Fingerprint - next week!

Hitchhikers,

have you seen 'Ready Player One' in cinema yet? No spoilers here - well, if I said there couldn't be any spoilers, would that constitute as one? :-) In any case, it's a spectacular film which touches on our recurring topic: the impact digital has on the way we live our lives, how we communicate, collaborate, work and learn. So go watch this entertaining Spielberg movie, The Atlantic calls it 'A mile wide, a Pixel deep' - and let's spend more time in the real life!

On that note: join our meetup next week, where (among other things) we speak about a certain Johannes Gutenberg and how his innovation was used to massively clog up letterboxes not too long ago. We're glad that the folks from News & Gossip are having us over again at their place in Robinson Road.

See you there - and have a good week!

Uli
