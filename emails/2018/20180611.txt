Subject: The event of the year - tomorrow!

Hitchhikers,

according to “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”,  the history of every major civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, known as the “How?”, “Why?”, and “Where?” phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question 'How can we find something to eat?' the second by the question 'Why do we eat, anyway?’ and the third by the question 'Where in town do they serve the best schnitzels?” With our dear friend Anthony Bourdain now missing, we’ll have to look for answers to that last question ourselves.

Our meetup is tomorrow - and it falls, of course, on a historic day. It’s the talk of the town, it’s all over the news and social media. The concert is sold out since months, and they’re even flying in two presidents from overseas so they can see that dude of ‘One Direction’ on stage at Buona Vista tomorrow. We’re most honoured if you’re coming to ‘Mostly Harmless’ instead!

Time & Date: Tuesday, June 12th 2018, 7 pm
Location: News & Gossip, Robinson Road, Singapore, 3rd planet from the sun
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/MostlyHarmlessSG/events/251359706/

Your host for the evening is Diana at the wonderful ‘News & Gossip’ cafe, where Riche and his team are serving Happy Hour drinks all night long just for us at their inspiring venue! We ask for your patience as we’re working with them to get the ‘Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster’ added to the list. This cocktail, with its effect described to be similar to “having your brains smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick" is almost impossible to make on planet Earth. But let's see how it goes and go with the classic red or a pint until then. Or three of those! 

We’re reasonably confident the world will still be in place after tomorrow - do bring a towel just in case!

Uli
