Hitchhikers,

I don't always get a seat on the bus when going to work in the morning, last week was one of these days again. Standing and grabbing one of those handles I was looking around and noticed a lady reading a book. And then, everybody else - literally everybody else - was on their phones.

Of course, the days are over when it was just about playing Candy Crush and browsing Facebook. You're able to get a considerable amount of work done on the phone. Many companies run entirely on WhatsApp. Are you still able to leave the house without the phone? These days it seems almost impossible to get a taxi if you're not booking it through an app.

I'll just assume you're reading this email on a phone as well - hoping this will make you smile :-) This is the other thing I realized. Devices and the hyper-connected life is a substantial stress factor. I didn't see too many people on that bus smiling into their phones. In my imagination, they'd probably feel things such as "Oh she's so pretty and I feel fat". "Oh nice he's in Phuket and I have to go to work". "Lobster. Uh huh. Been a while since I had one".

Less than 100 years ago, long-distance communication basically involved yelling at your neighbor. And look how far we've come, where the 'phone' is just an app on our smart device. An app that people use increasingly less to communicate with each other.

Let's talk about these things next week at our next meetup over a drink!
