Subject: Celebrating PRINT | Our meetup is on Tuesday!

Hitchhikers,

welcome to the only meetup group in Singapore that is 100% blockchain free - guaranteed! Or else you get your money back. If you actually read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy you realize that it highlights an important point: that usually, the question itself is more important than the answer. Blockchain seems to be the answer to just everything and it looks like people are fanatically brainstorming to come up with purposeful questions it could solve.

Back to the wonderful Hitchhiker book, it was Gutenberg's letterpress that allowed (almost) everyone to be a publisher. Before him, it was up to The Church to decide which content gets passed on to the public or the next generation. These days we've made the full jump to digital - when was the last time you received a handwritten letter? A Valentine's Day card you can hold in your hands and you'll discover it in your stuff a decade later? In 2018 it's mostly&nbsp;credit card statements and spam from real estate agents in your letterbox.

I grew up in Gutenberg's neighborhood, you can say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century and his letterpress one of the first pieces of information technology. Our meetup is on Tuesday and we have a few seats left - hope to see you there!
