Another mad year is coming to an end. Let's see it off in style and talk about things over a drink or three. Quantum physics. Paradoxes. The new lobster roll place down the road. And of course, how the earthlings can put aside all their differences for a moment and jointly agree that it would be a good idea to have 2019 happening!

This is 'Mostly Harmless', where geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meet over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. See you at the marvelous 'News & Gossip'!

Date: Tuesday, December 4th
Time: 7 pm
