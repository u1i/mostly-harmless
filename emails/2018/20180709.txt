Hitchhikers,

it's Monday yet again - and for some reason, the world is still in place! Welcome to this week's newsletter for our group of unicorns. Lets start with a riddle: what do you think which of the following statements are bogus:

1 - Our quirky little group got the attention of meetup.com, and the organizers might run a meta group & an event for meetup organizers in Singapore
2 - The creative chefs at our beloved News & Gossip Cafe have come up with a new dish in their 'Jurassic Pasta' series and are now serving crocodile meat spaghetti for lunch
3 - 

Time & Date: Tuesday, July 10th
Venue: The News & Gossip Cafe, Robinson Road, Singapore
