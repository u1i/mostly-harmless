Subject: Our 10th meetup is tomorrow!

Hitchhikers,

it's Monday yet again - and for some reason, the world is still in place! Welcome to this week's newsletter for our group of unicorns. Lets jumpstart our brains with a riddle: what do you think which of the following statements are true?

1 - Singapore is also the name of a city in Michigan, US which became a ghost town after huge fire in 1871
2 - Our quirky little group got the attention of meetup.com, and the organizers might actually run a meta group & an event for meetup organizers in Singapore
3 - The creative chefs at our beloved News & Gossip Cafe have come up with a new dish in their 'Jurassic Pasta' series and are now serving crocodile meat spaghetti for lunch

So now.... did you figure out which ones are bogus? We have some shocking news - they're all true! Isn't the world a wicked place? We hope to see you tomorrow for our next meetup. Your host of the evening is Diana.

$8 nett Asahi pints, anyone?
