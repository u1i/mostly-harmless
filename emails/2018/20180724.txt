Subject: Don't miss the Season Finale - next week!

Hitchhikers,

geeks, street philosophers, and junk food enthusiasts meeting over drinks after work to discuss current affairs and topics at the intersection of technology and humanity. It's fascinating to think of how the idea of the group came to be (over a drink, of course!), the evolution it took over the last couple of months and the topics we discussed - or were at least planning to. The change that Gutenbergâ€™s letterpress brought to the world. The invention of the telephone. Calculus. The internet. Trains, planes and automobiles. The changes we observe every day. And, of course, the best kebab places in town.

Join us next week Tuesday for the GREAT SEASON FINALE of 'Mostly Harmless'. If you have not attended one of our meetups so far, make sure you come this time. And for all the dear folks we've seen more than once at the wonderful 'News & Gossip', we'd love to have you with us again. Will the producers renew the show for another season? Are there going to be changes in the concept? Venue? Main cast? Gosh... that suspense!
