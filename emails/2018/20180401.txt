Subject: 5 spots left for the Tuesday meetup!

Hitchhikers!

we're just two days away from our next meetup, and there's only 5 spots left for Dante's Divine Comedy this week - geeks, bookworms and junk food enthusiasts meeting over drinks to discuss current affairs and hot topics at the intersection of technology, philosophy, physics, and humanity. We might even find a moment to speak about that wicked old book!

Our event is at the beautiful News & Gossip Cafe at 112 Robinson Road. Hope to see you on Tuesday!
