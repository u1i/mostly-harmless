Hitchhikers,

I'm not sure how you're spending this wonderfully rainy Sunday in Singapore, as for me - I'm just about to make another cup of Yorkshire tea and continue watching the documentaries on baroque music composers. Whatever it is that you do, we hope you can join us tomorrow for another discussion over drinks, where we talk about the invention of the phone and the continuous impact it has on the way we communicate, work, and learn.

Please RSVP: Swipe Right for Graham Bell -&nbsp;https://www.meetup.co...Â­

See you at the fabulous News & Gossip Cafe!
