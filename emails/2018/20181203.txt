Hitchhikers,

we know - your new year's resolution for 2019 will be to attend more of our wonderful meetups and enjoy stimulating conversations over drinks with fellow Hitchhikers in our intellectual panic room. Why don't you join us tomorrow instead already and save the resolutions for something even more useful?

It's our last meetup this year, hope to see you there!

Date: Tuesday, December 4th
Time: 7 pm
Location: News & Gossip, Robinson Road, Singapore
