Subject: Plato at the Googleplex - next week!

Hitchhikers,

how often do you use Google each day? I wouldn't be able to answer that for myself but know it's an 'oracle' I consult a lot, and may it just be to get the correct spelling of a particular word. You will have seen that search results even start to come up as you type, auto-completion style. Google has turned into a constantly learning, omniscient system and we're constantly feeding the beast by simply using it, particularly as now we have smart devices, chatbots and sensors speaking with Google on our behalf. Of course, as we're now entering the post-digital age, people are starting to be more aware about the impact on privacy and personal safety, question what we've just happily consumed earlier and are being more careful not to outsource too many of our cognitive funtions to machines. Many people in my network know this is a topic close to my heart.

It's exciting to see how our meetup is evolving into a platform in the real world where people connect, share ideas and passionately discuss these very things. We have a wonderful, quirky & inspiring space, conveniently located in the middle of CBD with the 'News & Gossip', interesting topics inspired by discussions at our meetup, and a growing group of hitchhikers who keep coming back! On that note, if you've been a silent follower in this group so far, do take a moment to consider getting involved.

On that note - our meetup is next week! Tuesday is a public holiday, so we're doing this on Wedneday instead.
