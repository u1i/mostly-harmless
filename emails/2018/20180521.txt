Subject: Plato at the Googleplex - next week!

Hitchhikers,

how often do you use Google every day? I wouldn't be able to answer that for myself but know it's an 'oracle' I consult a lot, and may it just be to get the correct spelling of a particular word. You will have seen that search results even start to come up as you type, auto-completion style. Google has turned into a constantly learning, omniscient system and we're constantly feeding the beast by using it, particularly as now we have smart devices, chatbots and sensors speaking with Google on our behalf.
