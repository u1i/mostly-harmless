Subject: The Theory of Everything

Happy Monday, Hitchhikers!

you have probably wondered what this meetup group is about - well, you're in great company!

So instead of (not) reading a long email about modern life being increasingly non-deterministic, if this piqued your interest why not join us for a drink instead tomorrow after work so we can talk about these things?

The Theory of Everything

Is there intelligent life on earth? What are some of Stephen Hawking's big ideas? And where in town do they have the best kebap?

Join us for our #1 non-deterministic meetup with discussions over drinks in the heart of CBD. Capacity is limited - please only reply if you're confident you can be there.
