Subject: It's that time of the week!

Hitchhikers,

how time flies! So I'm taking a risk that some folks will blame this on my age - but 2018 just feels like running at an incredible pace.
If you're like me, you've just come off that wonderfully relaxing weekend, getting thrown right into a mad day at work, and Friday is still far away in the future. Sounds familiar? Now, we can't do much about your work schedule but do have a suggestion how to make the week a lot more tolerable. Like... a lot!

Join us tomorrow evening for a drink after work and a light discussion on current affairs, the curious story of Pope Gregory fixing bugs in the system, and our plans for a petition for In-N-Out Burger to launch in Singapore.
We love our meetups at the News & Gossip Cafe, our regular patrons coming to the event and enjoy the steady stream of new faces joining the conversation.

See you tomorrow - if you have time!
